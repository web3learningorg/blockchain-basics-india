## ⚔️ Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake: The Consensus Battle Powering Blockchain’s Future

Behind every blockchain transaction lies a **consensus mechanism** deciding what’s valid, what’s secure, and what survives attacks. The biggest debate in crypto today?  
👉 **Proof of Work (PoW) vs Proof of Stake (PoS)**.

Bitcoin relies on **PoW**, where miners solve energy-intensive cryptographic puzzles to secure the network. It’s battle-tested, highly secure—but costly and power-hungry.  
Newer networks like **Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana** favor **PoS**, where validators stake crypto instead of burning electricity, enabling faster, cheaper, and greener transactions.

This article breaks it all down clearly:
- 🔐 How **PoW mining** actually secures Bitcoin  
- 🌱 Why **PoS staking & slashing** changed blockchain economics  
- ⚡ Energy usage, scalability, and decentralization compared  
- 🏦 Real-world adoption: Bitcoin vs Ethereum’s PoS transition  
- ❓ FAQs on 51% attacks, validators, and security models  

If you’ve ever wondered:
- *Why Ethereum abandoned PoW*  
- *Whether PoS is really more secure*  
- *Which consensus model will dominate Web3*
