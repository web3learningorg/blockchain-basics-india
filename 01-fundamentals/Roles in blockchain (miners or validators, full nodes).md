## What Is a Blockchain Node? The Backbone of Decentralized Networks

Every blockchain—whether Bitcoin, Ethereum, or a DeFi protocol—runs on **nodes**. Without them, decentralization, security, and trustless transactions would not exist.

This guide explains:
- What a **blockchain node** is and why it’s essential  
- Differences between **full nodes, light (SPV) nodes, mining nodes, staking nodes, and archive nodes**  
- How nodes **validate transactions, maintain the distributed ledger, and reach consensus**  
- The role of nodes in **PoW, PoS, and DPoS** systems  
- What it takes to **run your own blockchain node** (hardware, software, benefits & challenges)

If you want to understand how blockchains stay secure without a central authority—or plan to run a node yourself—this is a must-read.
