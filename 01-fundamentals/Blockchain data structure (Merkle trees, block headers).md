## Merkle Trees: The Hidden Backbone of Blockchain Security

Without **Merkle trees**, modern blockchains like **Bitcoin and Ethereum simply wouldn’t scale or remain trustless**. These cryptographic data structures make it possible to verify transactions efficiently without downloading entire blocks—a core requirement for decentralized systems.

This guide explains:
- What **Merkle trees** are and how binary hash trees work  
- Why the **Merkle root** is critical for block integrity and immutability  
- How **Merkle proofs** enable light clients and SPV verification  
- The role of Merkle trees in **Bitcoin vs Ethereum (Patricia trees)**  
- Key advantages, limitations, and the **future with Verkle & ZK integrations**

If you want to truly understand how blockchains stay secure, scalable, and tamper-proof, this is a must-read.
