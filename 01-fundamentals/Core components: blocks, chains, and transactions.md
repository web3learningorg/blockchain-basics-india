## 🔐 By 2025, 10% of the World’s GDP Could Run on Blockchain — But Do You Know *How* It Works?

Blockchain isn’t just powering Bitcoin anymore.  
From **DeFi and NFTs** to **smart contracts and enterprise systems**, blockchain is quietly becoming the backbone of the digital economy. Experts predict that **nearly 10% of global GDP may be secured by blockchain technology by 2025**.

But here’s the real question 👇  
**What actually makes blockchain so secure that even the world’s fastest supercomputers can’t cheat it?**

It all comes down to its **core architecture**:
- 🌐 A global network of **nodes** validating data independently  
- 🧱 Precisely structured **blocks** with headers, hashes, and Merkle roots  
- 🔁 A **distributed vs decentralized ledger** model most people confuse  
- ⚙️ **Consensus mechanisms** like Proof of Work and nonce calculation  
- 🔒 Cryptography that ensures immutability and trust without intermediaries

- *How transactions are verified step by step*  
- *Why changing one block breaks the entire chain*  
- *What really happens inside a block header*  
- *Why blockchain is more than just crypto*
