## 🚀 Why Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks Dominate Web3

Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are the **hidden engine behind Web3**, powering blockchain, DeFi, IPFS, and decentralized apps. Unlike traditional client–server systems, P2P architectures eliminate single points of failure, improve scalability, and enable true censorship resistance.

From **BitTorrent and Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs)** to **blockchain consensus and decentralized storage**, P2P networks allow users to communicate, transact, and share data **directly—without intermediaries**.

If you want to understand **why P2P outperforms centralized systems**, how it enables **trustless Web3 infrastructure**, and where its future is heading, this guide breaks it down in a simple and practical way.
