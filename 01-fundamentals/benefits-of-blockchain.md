# Understanding Blockchain Technology: How It Works, Types & Real-World Applications

Blockchain technology is a decentralized, secure, and tamper-resistant digital ledger system that enables transparent transactions without intermediaries. Originally introduced with Bitcoin in 2009, blockchain has evolved into a foundational technology powering Web3, decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and enterprise solutions.

This comprehensive guide explains **what blockchain is**, **how it works**, **why it is secure**, and **how it is used in real-world industries** such as supply chain, healthcare, finance, and digital identity.

## Blockchain Technology – Quick Overview

Blockchain is a distributed ledger where transactions are grouped into cryptographically linked blocks and shared across a decentralized network of nodes. Once data is recorded, it cannot be altered without network consensus, making blockchain highly secure and trustworthy.
