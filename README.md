## Tutorial 1: Blockchain Fundamentals and Architecture

### Core Concepts
- What is a Blockchain? (basic definition and analogy)  
- History of Blockchain and Bitcoin (origin story)  
- Core components: blocks, chains, and transactions  
- Decentralization and peer-to-peer (P2P) networks  
- Consensus mechanisms (Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, etc.)  
- Cryptography in blockchain (hashing, digital signatures)  

### Blockchain Types & Structure
- Public vs. Private vs. Consortium blockchains  
- Blockchain data structure (Merkle trees, block headers)  
- Roles in blockchain (miners/validators, full nodes)  
- Network nodes (full nodes vs. light wallets)  

### Comparison & Properties
- Blockchain vs. traditional databases  
- Immutability and security properties  

### Smart Contracts & Platforms
- Smart contracts basics (self-executing code)  
- Popular platforms (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger, etc.)  

### Benefits & Challenges
- Benefits of blockchain (security, transparency, trustlessness)  
- Challenges and limitations (scalability, energy use, regulation)  

### Practical Basics
- Key blockchain use cases (finance, supply chain, identity, etc.)  
- Basics of blockchain wallets and addresses

## Tutorial 2: How Blockchain Works (Technical Deep Dive)

### Transactions & Networking
- Anatomy of a blockchain transaction (inputs, outputs)  
- Transaction validation and propagation in a P2P network  

### Mining & Consensus
- Mining and block creation process (Proof of Work)  
- Block rewards and incentives for miners  
- Alternative consensus mechanisms:
  - Proof of Stake (PoS)  
  - Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)  
  - Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)  

### Blockchain Mechanics
- Difficulty adjustment and block time (Bitcoin example)  
- Transaction confirmations and finality  
- Preventing double-spending  

### Smart Contracts & Fees
- Smart contract execution within blocks (Ethereum example)  
- Gas and transaction fees (Ethereum gas model)  

### Forks & Upgrades
- Blocks and forks (soft forks vs. hard forks)  
- Consensus protocol upgrades (e.g., Ethereum Merge)  

### Practical Tools
- Using block explorers (tracking transactions and blocks)  
- Example walkthrough: sending a transaction on Bitcoin or Ethereum  
- Node synchronization (initial sync, bloom filters)

- Fintech adoption (digital KYC, insurance claims)  
- Startup ecosystem:
  - Polygon  
  - WazirX  
  - CoinDCX  

### Community & Future Outlook
- Collaboration and hackathons (India Blockchain Summit)  
- Future trends and opportunities in India’s blockchain adoption  
- Challenges in India:
  - Infrastructure limitations  
  - Awareness gaps  
  - Regulatory hurdles
